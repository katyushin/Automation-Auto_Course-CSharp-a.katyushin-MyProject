    <description>MSBuild.NUnit provides support for NUnit in MSBuild.</description>
    <summary>MSBuild.NUnit is more flexible than the NUnit support available in MSBuild Community Tasks as it allows for support of NUnit versions greater than 2.4. This project is a fork of monoman's MSBuild.NUnit project. This fork cleans up the project structure and code for better maintainability. More importantly, a proper build script has been added as well as proper NuGet package support.</summary>
